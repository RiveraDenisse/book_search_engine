## Description

Week 21 was to take a functioning Google Books API search engine built with RESTful API and refactor it using GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. In order to complete the challenge, we would need to set up an Apollo server to use GraphQL to fetch and modify data, modify the authentication middleware to work with GraphQL API, create an Apollo Provide so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
